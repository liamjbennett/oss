### Submitting Pull Requests
So you've decided you want to send us some code. That's awesome. No,
really, thank you.

To get you started, we put together this handy-dandy guide to submitting
your patch:

0. [Fork][] and clone the repository
0. Configure and install the dependencies: `script/bootstrap`
0. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `script/test`
0. Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b my-awesome-patch`
0. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
0. Add a CHANGELOG entry detailing your changes
0. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
0. Accept the [OpenTable CLA][cla]
0. :beers:

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the style guide (see below) where possible.
- Write tests.
- Update documentation as necessary.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you
would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting
them as separate pull requests.
- Squash multiple commits into a single, clean commit.
